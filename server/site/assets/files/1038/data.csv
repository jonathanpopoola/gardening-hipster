Carnivorous plants are  amongst natureâs most intriguing flora and are enjoying unprecedented popularity with todayâs gardeners. The ability of these plants to attract, catch and consume insects and unwanted pests truly sets them apart from other plant species. Outdoor grown Carnivorous plants do not require any additional feed as they usually catch more than enough insects to keep them healthy. Insects can be fed by hand to supplement their diet a Carnivorous plant that catches no insects will rarely die, although its growth will be impaired.","Carnivorous Plants Collection A",http://www.jerseyplantsdirect.com/carnivorous-plants-collection-a,http://images.productserve.com/preview/5/1485/67/55/697835567.jpg,,1485,"Plants & Seeds",456,,GBP,,GBP18.98,1485,,,,

Like all sweet peas Patio Perfect likes to root deeply so choose pots with a depth of at least 12 inches, large pots such as these will also reduce the risk of your sweet peas drying out in warm summer weather.  Use a good compost such as a blend of 'universal' and John Innes 3 which will give give structure and aid moisture retention.  Be sure to water regularly - containers must never dry out - and feed once a week during flowering. Patio Perfect is also great for baskets and will trail gently over the sides under it's own weight.  Again using large baskets such as Easy Fills is best to guard against moisture loss For best results ''stop' the plants by removing half an inch from the tips soon after planting.

They are perfect for growing up trellis, over pergolas or against any support. All varieties are sweetly scented with the perfume being at it's very best on warm summer days and from blooms that are freshly fully opened. At peak flowering time from mid June to late July these sweet peas will give long strong stems of around 12in in length, each bearing three or four wavy blooms.  Sweet Peas are very thirsty at this time and daily watering along with a weekly high potash feed will keep them flowering to their full potential.  Remember also to pick all the blooms or to dead-head as they fade as this will also greatly prolong flowering Choose either seeds or nursery grown plants below.

The result of 15 years breeding by a Japanese enthusiast, these little Jewels sparkle all Summer long - but are both incredibly drought tolerant. and yet Hardy too! Most people probably have not heard of Delopsperma, but they are close relations of other trailing succulent types like commonly known Mesembryanthemum, and the borderline hardy Lampranthus often seen on dry stone walls in Cornwall and the South West. The new Jewel of the Desert series all have a distinctive white ring around the centre of their profuse flowers, giving them a completely new look too, sitting tight into their foliage. Although quite small, the flowers smother the established plants all Summer long. They love being baked warm and dry in our Summer sun, and conversely hate wet feet in Winter. Therefore we suggest growing in pots, in well-drained soil with added grit and sand. They will spread to cover the pots, and trail down over the side.

A 'little and often' approach to trimming of the young, soft shoots will allow you to easily keep it to the shape and size that suits you. It is very easy to manage and can be kept in post on the patio for many years, where it will happily sit at centre stage of your displays. Once it has reached the desired height and width, prune the new growth in early summer and mid-autumn each year. A hedge trimmer will leave the perfect finish. Golden Scented Cypress will grow in virtually any soil and in any location from full sun to partial shade (although for the brightest of golden-yellow colour it is best in full sun).

It was successfully created by cross-breeding our common wild Foxgloves (Digitalis) with the exotic Isoplexis (Canary Island Foxglove) relative, which gives it a beautiful tropical colouration, and it's distinctive petal and flower shapes too. Despite being called 'Pink', it's centre is a lovely warm, orange-tinged tropical shade. Because it is sterile, it will not set seed, so focusses all it's energy into flowering - for very long lasting displays from June well into Autumn - much much longer than wild foxgloves do. It is shorter and more robust too with stems only to 75cm or so. Because it is so new, and has inherited it's tropical cousins' exotic genes, it is not certain to be reliably hardy.
